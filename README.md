# Data Analysis for Wildfire Detections by MODIS and VIIRS

This repository contains code analyzing the 2023 German yearly report of wildfire detections by the MODIS and VIIRS systems obtained from NASA's [FIRMS](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/).

It analyzes differences in detection time (expectedly not very different).
Also, it shows examples of high confidence false alarms due to steel mills near Duisburg and Dillingen.

This code was used for a report for the course "Remote Sensing Image Analysis" at University of Tokyo.
The report can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/severinsch/wildfire-satellite-report).
